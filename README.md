# FileBatchRenamer

A simple command-line tool for batch renaming files in a directory. This script allows you to rename files with a specified extension to a new name, with an incremental suffix to avoid overwriting existing files.

## Features

- Rename files in a specified directory.
- Specify file extensions to target.
- Provide a new base name for the files.
- Incremental numbering to ensure unique filenames.
- Command-line interface with colored prompts using `picocolors`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Artemisx3/FileBatchRenamer.git
   cd FileBatchRenamer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have dependencies installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**

   - Enter the directory path where the files are located.
   - Specify the file extension of the files you want to rename (e.g., `jpg`, `mp4`, `.doc`, etc.).
   - Provide a new base name for the files.

   The script will rename all files with the specified extension in the given directory, appending an incremental number to each file name.

3. **Options**

   - **Option 1**: Rename files in a certain directory.
   - **Option 2**: Exit the program.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the script works:

```
1. Rename files in certain directory to
2. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the directory: C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Pictures\MyImages
Enter the extension name of the files you'd like to change (e.g. jpg, png, etc.): png
Enter the new name for the files: vacation
```

If the directory contains files like `photo1.png`, `photo2.png`, etc., the script will rename them to `vacation-0.png`, `vacation-1.png`, etc.
